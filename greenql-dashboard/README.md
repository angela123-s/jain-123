# Green QL | Foundations of Data Optimization

**Green QL** is a high-performance GraphQL query optimization suite designed to eliminate data over-fetching and improve sustainable computing metrics.

## 🚀 Overview

Green QL acts as a sophisticated middleware layer that analyzes GraphQL requests and filters outgoing payloads to ensure only requested fields are transmitted. This results in:
- **98% Reduction** in average payload weight.
- **Improved Latency** by minimizing serialization overhead.
- **Sustainable Footprint** by reducing network energy consumption.

## 🛠 Project Structure

- **`/mobile-simulator`**: A high-fidelity simulator demonstrating Green QL's impact on Social and E-commerce applications.
- **`/greenql-dashboard`**: The official monitoring interface for real-time visualization of data efficiency.

## 🎨 Design System

Green QL uses a bespoke **Bento Grid** aesthetic:
- **Primary Color**: Neon Emerald (`#10B981`)
- **Base Palette**: Deep Charcoal & Slate
- **Typography**: Outfit (UI) & JetBrains Mono (Streams)
